# Java Data Management and Multithreading Projects

This repository contains three Java programs that demonstrate core concepts such as data structures, collections, and multithreading to manage and manipulate data. Each program addresses a specific use case:

1. **Employee Management System**: Manages employee details using an `ArrayList`.
2. **Card Collection System**: Collects and stores cards using the `Collection` interface.
3. **Ticket Booking System**: Simulates a ticket booking system with synchronized threads and thread priorities.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase Java programming skills in handling data structures, collections, and multithreading. Each program is self-contained and demonstrates a different aspect of Java programming:

- **Employee Management System**: Allows users to add, update, remove, and search employee records.
- **Card Collection System**: Enables users to add cards and find all cards of a given symbol.
- **Ticket Booking System**: Ensures thread-safe booking of seats with priority handling for VIP bookings.

## Features

- **Employee Management System**:
  - Add, update, remove, and search employees.
  - Stores employee details (ID, Name, Salary) in an `ArrayList`.

- **Card Collection System**:
  - Add cards to a collection.
  - Search for cards by symbol.
  - Utilizes the `Collection` interface for flexibility.

- **Ticket Booking System**:
  - Synchronized threads to prevent double booking.
  - Thread priorities to process VIP bookings first.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-data-management.git
   cd java-data-management
